	<h1>Work</h1>
	<p>This is a public repository for my latest open source code Data Science application in diverse topics. Each link will take you to the github repository which
  contains the codes and the pdf or html file of the results</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Machine Learning - Prediction of bank clients that will make a deposit Part II: test of different 
			Machine Learning methods (Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, 
			Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks and Ensemble Methods) 
			in a dataset of a Marketing Campaign in a bank to determine which 
			clients are more likely to perfom a deposit</li>
		<li>Machine Learning - Prediction of bank clients that will make a deposit Part I: pre-process of a dataset of a marketing 
			campaign in a bank to promote deposits cointining demographic information of clients, 
			characterization of the latest contact and previous campaigns, 
			information of the relationship with the client and results of the campaign. Test of different 
			probabilistic methods (logistic regression, shinkage methods, Bayes Classifiers and Cost-Sensitive Learning techniques) 
			for prediction of the clients that will make deposits</li>
		<li>Programming - KNN function to program in R</li>
		<li>Master's dissertation - "Non- modellability under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB)"</li>
